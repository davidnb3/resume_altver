          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Very Open minded human being with a pleasant personality, passionate about all sciences and tech, seeking for an innovative career change. Having experienced different jobs and studied many different topics, I decided to continue educating myself, to be able to work in a field that I enjoy and to build up a good life in the coming years. That’s why I chose to follow the web developer path on Openclassrooms, to which I can also successfully integrate my communication and analytical skills from my previous experiences.</p>

                <p>Brussels, 2015 - 2017</p>
                <p>I started studying psychology, where I learned a lot about human and animal behaviour, until I found myself reading more books about physics and making music than studying the science for which I actually was at university.</p>

                <p>Currently working as an accountant in a bus and travel agency, where I’m learning to pay attention to details and stimulating my analytical thinking.
